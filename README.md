# Mattress Mayhem (Phaser 3)

A small 2D browser action game built with **Phaser 3** using only placeholder graphics.

## Run

Open `index.html` via **GitHub Pages** (or any static file host/server).

The game script is loaded from `main.js` at the project root to keep GitHub Pages paths simple.

## Gameplay

### Start screen
- Click **Play** to begin.

### Level 1: Mattress Store
- Enemies: bed bugs.
- Goal: survive and reach the **exit on the right side** of the store.

### Level 2: Parking Lot Boss
- Boss: fuel-line thief with a larger health pool.
- Two attack patterns:
  - High-speed **dash** toward the player.
  - **Shockwave ring** projectiles fired outward.

## Controls
- **Move:** `W A S D` or arrow keys
- **Attack:** `Space`

## UI
- Player HP is shown in all gameplay scenes.
- Boss HP bar is shown during the boss level.


## Troubleshooting
- If you previously tested an older version and see module/import errors, do a hard refresh so the latest `main.js` is loaded.
